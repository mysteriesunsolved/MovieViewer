## Notes

I took time to figure out how to use the search bar with an NSDictionary.
I couldn't figure out how to implement the network error view.

# Project 2 - *Movie Viewer/Flicks*

**Flicks** is a movies app displaying box office and top rental DVDs using [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can view movie details by tapping on a cell.
- [x] User can select from a tab bar for either **Now Playing** or **Top Rated** movies.
- [x] Customize the selection effect of the cell. (I didn't want to customise the selection effect since there'd be too much colour on the screen, so I set the cell selection style to none)

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- Release dates are displayed below the movie (makes more sense for top rated movies given varied time periods).
- Ratings for each movie are shown with icons and vote average.
- The icons change depending on the rating of the movie. If the rating is greater than 7, it displays a fire icon, if greater than 5, it displays a thumbs up icon, and if lesser than 5 it displays a thumbs down icon.
- If a movie's vote count = 0, making the average rating 0 be default, "No ratings to show" is displayed in the rating section.
- Added a network error view I didn't finish last week.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
